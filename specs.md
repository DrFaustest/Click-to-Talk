# Click-to-Talk Project Specifications

## Project Overview
Click-to-Talk is a desktop application that enables voice-controlled mouse navigation for computer use. It translates voice commands into system-wide mouse movements and clicks, assisting users with motor coordination difficulties in navigating any application or web browser.

## Evaluation and Design Rationale
After evaluating the project requirements and original design intent, the implementation will use Python for speech recognition and mouse control, as outlined in the README. This approach provides full system mouse control (not limited to browsers) and aligns with the original technology stack proposal. While Python requires installation, it's widely available and the simplest way to achieve comprehensive voice-controlled mouse functionality.

### Why This Design?
- **Alignment with Original Design**: Uses Python speech-to-text libraries as specified in the README.
- **Full System Control**: Can control the mouse across all applications, not just web browsers.
- **Simplicity**: Straightforward Python script with minimal dependencies.
- **Ease of Implementation**: Leverages established libraries for speech and mouse control.

## Languages and Packages

### Languages
- **Python 3.8+**: Primary language for the application.
  - Used for speech recognition, command processing, and mouse control.

### Packages/Libraries
- **speech_recognition**: For converting speech to text using various APIs (Google, Sphinx, etc.).
- **pyautogui**: For programmatic mouse and keyboard control.
- **pyaudio** (dependency of speech_recognition): For microphone audio input.
- **Optional: pynput**: Alternative for more advanced input simulation if needed.

All packages can be installed via pip and are cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Implementation Pathways

### 1. Speech Recognition Setup
- Initialize speech_recognition with microphone input.
- Configure for continuous listening with adjustable energy threshold.
- Support multiple recognition engines (Google API, offline Sphinx).
- Handle microphone permissions and device selection.

### 2. Command Parsing
- Implement voice command recognition for:
  - Movement: "move up", "move down", "move left", "move right" (with pixel distances)
  - Clicks: "left click", "right click", "double click"
  - Navigation: "scroll up", "scroll down"
  - System: "show cursor", "hide cursor"
- Use keyword matching and simple NLP for command interpretation.

### 3. Mouse Control Implementation
- Use pyautogui for precise mouse positioning and clicking.
- Implement smooth cursor movement with configurable speed.
- Add cursor highlighting/visual feedback when requested.
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Mac/Linux).

### 4. User Interface and Feedback
- Console-based interface for status display.
- Audio feedback for command recognition and execution.
- Optional GUI overlay for cursor position and settings.
- Keyboard shortcuts for start/stop control.

### 5. Configuration and Customization
- Configurable command keywords and sensitivity settings.
- Adjustable movement speeds and click delays.
- Profile support for different users or use cases.

### 6. Error Handling and Safety
- Graceful handling of recognition failures.
- Safety timeouts to prevent accidental rapid clicking.
- Clear error messages and fallback behaviors.
- Emergency stop commands ("stop", "quit").

### 7. Packaging and Distribution
- Create executable with PyInstaller for easy distribution.
- Provide installation scripts for different platforms.
- Include uninstallation and update mechanisms.

## Development Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Set up basic speech recognition and mouse control.
2. **Phase 2**: Implement command parsing and basic movements.
3. **Phase 3**: Add click simulation and navigation commands.
4. **Phase 4**: Build configuration system and user interface.
5. **Phase 5**: Testing, cross-platform compatibility, and packaging.
6. **Phase 6**: Documentation, accessibility features, and final polish.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for command parsing and mouse functions.
- Integration testing with various applications and websites.
- Performance testing for continuous recognition.
- User testing with different accents and speaking styles.
- Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Deployment
- Distribute as Python package (pip install) or executable.
- Provide source code for advanced users.
- Include comprehensive setup instructions.
- Consider open-source licensing for community contributions.
